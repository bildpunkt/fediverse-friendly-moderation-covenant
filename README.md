# The Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant

The Fediverse is, while already existing for a while in all kinds, rapidly growing and changing. Current-day Fediverse software can employ all kinds of moderation, improving on the lack thereof from platforms that were used before (e.g. Twitter), but features given, if used too thoroughly can also impact the integrity of the natural growth and communication of the network.

This covenant isn't here to replace an instances set of rules. It's simply an extension that administration/moderation can pledge to follow so the networks integrity and the ability of users to interact with as many people as possible is kept intact.

You can find the covenant in [covenant.md](covenant.md). Simply take the raw markdown or text format, adjust it to your needs  and copy it in your instances rules/terms.
